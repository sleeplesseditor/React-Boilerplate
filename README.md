# React-Boilerplate
This is my react-boilerplate app for developing React apps. Babel, Express and Webpack are included, and the app is ready for deployment.

The application was built using Nick Karnik's guide at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-2f8cbbeb9b3f.

## Setup
1) npm install
2) npm run build
3) npm start
